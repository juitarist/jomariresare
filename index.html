            <p class="descrip">I'm a proponent of the idea that all guys need to know how to work on their car. Not anything advanced like diagnosing a cylinder misfire (though that may not really be advanced to some) but moreso understanding oil change, wheel change, and brake change. Very simple stuff (I think). I like ICEs but EV is okay. Dream car at one point was a 1994 Supra.</p>

            <h3>Philosophy and Sociology</h3>
            <p class="descrip">"I said I wanted a degree in metaphysics, so what was all that math for?" I like people. More specifically, I'll like a person. Each individual has their own experience of this world and it's neat to hear their perspective on things. Honestly, I believe people are losing touch of personal relationships since the new age of social media and the psudo-interconnectivity of people on the internet. I like to listen to people, so if you ever want to talk it up <a href="https://next-jomar.vercel.app/contact" target="_blank"> find me at my socials. </a> </p>
            <p class="descrip">I love learning new things and long walks on the beach.</p>
